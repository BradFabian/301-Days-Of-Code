### Day 1: 03/25/2019

**Today's Progress:** Forked the 301 days of Code Repo. Helped a friend fix his responsivness and font scaling on his website.

**Thoughts:** I spent a half hour teaching my friend how to use relative and absolute properties to manipulate text 

**Link to work:** We added a position relative to his div and put the text into seperate span elements with the property of absolute. We used left, right , up and down to psotion the text by % and align it to what he envisioned.
