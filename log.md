# #301DaysOfCode - Log
The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: 03/25/2019

**Today's Progress:** Forked the 301 days of Code Repo. Helped a friend fix his responsivness and font scaling on his website.

**Thoughts:** I spent a half hour teaching my friend how to use relative and absolute properties to manipulate text 

**Link to work:** We added a position relative to his div and put the text into seperate span elements with the property of absolute. We used left, right , up and down to psotion the text by % and align it to what he envisioned. 


### Day 2: 03/26/2019

**Today's Progress:** Began building a real time shopping list for the wife and I  to update and remove items. Wrote code setting up the Express API with MongoDb and tomorrow will intergrate with Node , React and hopefully deploy to Heroku by the weekend.


**Thoughts:** Its been six months since I attempted a full out MERN app ... A little rusty but it feels good being in the saddle again.

**Link to work:** No Link yet! (Yikes, I filled out my day one incorrectly!)
